Which of the following pairs of compounds can be used to illustrate the law of multiple proportions?

    NH4 and NH4Cl
    ZnO2 and ZnCl2
    H2O and HCl
    NO and NO2
    CH4 and CO2

A sample of chemical X is found to contain 5.0 grams of oxygen, 10.0 grams of carbon, and 20.0
grams of nitrogen. The law of definite proportion would predict that a 70 gram sample of chemical
X should contain how many grams of carbon?
How many of the following postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory are still scientifically accepted?

    All atoms of the same element are identical.
    Compounds are combinations of different atoms.
    A chemical reaction changes the way atoms are grouped together.
    Atoms are indestructible.

Who was the first scientist to show that atoms emit any negative particles?
Many classic experiments have given us indirect evidence of the nature of the atom. Which of the experiments listed below did not give the results described?

    The Rutherford experiment proved the Thomson “plum-pudding” model of the atom to be essentially correct.
    The Rutherford experiment was useful in determining the nuclear charge on the atom.
    Millikan’s oil-drop experiment showed that the charge on any particle was a simple multiple of the charge on the electron.
    The electric discharge tube proved that electrons have a negative charge.
    All of the above experiments gave the results described.
